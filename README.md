ESI pagination TLDR: Use the X-Pages header returned from paginated ESI endpoints to determine how many calls are needed to get all data from a given endpoint.

Save capsuleer
- id
- name
- known alts
- last seen location
- bounty
- known ship types

Add search text box on main screen to search by capsuleer name.
That would have to find the ID given the name.
Show /character screen, but include above info, which may be modified.

Can run:
npm start
npm run pretest
npm run unit-test
npm run test

TODO:
Sort location list.
Make alts, last_seen_location, bounty and ship_types editable.
